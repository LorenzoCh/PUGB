INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND

PlayerUnknown’s Battleground(PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game that has amassed over 400 million players. In the upcoming year of 2019, PUBG will inaugurate a Global Championship that features 2 million dollars in reward.

As an emerging Esports’ event, PUBG still lacks effective analysis that are based on players’ stats. As a team, we built a statistical model that can predict a player’s final ranking, which is a strong indication of his/her gaming skill, based on post-game stats. We believe our model would be helpful to find potential top players.
